Keypads are a simple way to authenticate users. After crafting a keypad, place it somewhere (e.g. next to a door) and
use
it. The first time, it will ask you to set a code. This can be pretty much any length of numbers. After that, it will
only unlock if you enter the correct code. On entering the correct code, the keypad will emit a redstone signal.

This can just be used to open a door, or activate any redstone circuit.

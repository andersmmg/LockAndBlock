Keycards are used with [keycard readers](^lockandblock:keycard_reader) to authenticate users. After crafting a keycard,
you'll need to write to it with
a [keycard writer](^lockandblock:keycard_writer). Then, use it on a new keycard reader to program the reader to this
keycard. If you need another keycard
that works with your keycard reader, you can use the [keycard cloner](^lockandblock:keycard_cloner).

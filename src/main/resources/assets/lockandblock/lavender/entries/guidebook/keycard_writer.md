Keycard writers are used to write to a [keycard](^lockandblock:keycard) for use in readers. Before writing to a keycard,
they have no data and
will do nothing. Just use a keycard on a writer, and it will write a randomised code to the keycard, which is read by
[keycard readers](^lockandblock:keycard_reader) to authenticate.

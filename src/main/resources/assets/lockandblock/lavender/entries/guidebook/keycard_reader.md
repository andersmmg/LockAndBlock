Keycard readers are used to read [keycards](^lockandblock:keycard). Keycards are used with keycard readers to
authenticate users, and will
then emit a redstone signal from the reader. These can be placed next to doors to open them, or the redstone signal can
be fed into any
redstone circuit to control whatever you want!

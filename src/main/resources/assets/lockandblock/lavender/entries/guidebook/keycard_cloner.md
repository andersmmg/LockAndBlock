Keycard cloners are used to make copies of [keycards](^lockandblock:keycard). To use them, you'll need a blank keycard,
and a written keycard you want to clone. Just use the written card on the cloner to save the data into the cloner, then
use the blank card on it to write the copied data into the blank card. The new card will now work anywhere the old one
did! The cloner will only copy to one card,

;;;;;

you'll need to save the data to the cloner again each time you want to copy
to another card. If you have a card saved and you want to remove it or set a new one, sneak and use the cloner with an
empty hand to clear it.
